# OctoAcme Project Management Docs — README

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This README provides a short overview of how OctoAcme runs projects, an introductory section useful for onboarding, and direct links to the full process documents in this folder.

## Intro / Purpose
This docs set is the single entry point for learning how OctoAcme initiates, plans, executes, and reviews projects. It is intended for new teammates, project leads, stakeholders, and anyone needing a quick orientation into our ways of working.

## OctoAcme Project Management — Summary
OctoAcme follows an iterative, evidence-driven project delivery model with the following lifecycle:
- Initiation: Define objectives, stakeholders, scope, and success criteria; identify key risks and assumptions.
- Planning: Break down the work into milestones and deliverables, estimate effort, allocate owners, and set success metrics.
- Execution & Tracking: Deliver incrementally, track progress against milestones, maintain transparent status reporting and cadence meetings.
- Release & Deployment: Coordinate release readiness, QA, and deployment runbooks; validate acceptance criteria before release.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement: Capture lessons learned, track action items, and evolve processes based on evidence.

Core principles: clear ownership, stakeholder alignment, measurable milestones, evidence-based decisions, and continuous improvement.

## Onboarding / How to use these docs
1. Start with the Project Management Overview to understand the lifecycle and principles.
2. Read the Initiation and Planning guides for concrete steps you must follow at project start.
3. Use the Execution & Tracking and Release guides while running and shipping work.
4. After delivery, run through the Retrospective guide to capture improvements.
